Regex (regular expression) A regex is a pattern used to match, search, validate, or replace text based on rules instead of exact characters.
Common regex patterns
	•	. → any single character
	•	* → 0 or more of previous
	•	+ → 1 or more of previous
	•	? → 0 or 1 of previous
	•	^ → start of string
	•	$ → end of string
Character classes
	•	\d → digit (0–9)
	•	\D → non-digit
	•	\w → letter, digit, underscore
	•	\W → non-word character
	•	\s → whitespace
	•	\S → non-whitespace
Sets & ranges
	•	[abc] → a, b, or c
	•	[a-z] → lowercase letters
	•	[^0-9] → not a digit
Quantifiers
	•	{3} → exactly 3 times
	•	{2,5} → 2 to 5 times
	•	{2,} → 2 or more times
Groups
	•	(abc) → capture group
	•	(?:abc) → non-capturing group
	•	\1 → reference to first capture
Anchors & boundaries
	•	\b → word boundary
	•	\B → not a word boundary
Examples
	•	Email (basic): \w+@\w+\.\w+
	•	Only numbers: ^\d+$
	•	Remove file extension: \.[^.]+$
	•	Match year: (19|20)\d{2}
If you want, I can tailor this to filename renaming specifically.
